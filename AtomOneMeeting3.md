## AtomOne Chain Updates

* Activated PHOTON-only fees immediately, completing the fee side of the
  dual-token model before v3.  
    * [Prop 10](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/10)

* Signaling proposals for v3 features:
    * [Prop 9](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/9): Dynamic deposits will make it
      so proposal costs rise when governance activity spikes and fall when it
      cools. It will also burn proposals deposit if the percentage of no votes
      exceeds the set threshold (currently 80%).
    * [Prop 11](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/11): Added dynamic quorums that
      adjust governance turnout requirements to real participation.
    * [Prop 15](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/15): Dynamic fees à la EIP1559,
       with dynamic learning rate (additive increase, multiplicative decrease)
    * [Prop 14](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/14): Converted most ATONE in the
      Treasury and Community Pool into PHOTON.

* V3 upgrade (Nov 18th)

      Nakamoto Bonus to improve decentralization.
